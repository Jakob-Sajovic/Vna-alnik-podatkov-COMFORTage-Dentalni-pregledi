 * Storage port.

 * The tabs know how to collect an examination; they do not know where it is
 * kept. The Office add-in supplies an ExcelStore that talks to the host
 * workbook; the standalone PWA supplies a PwaStore backed by IndexedDB and
 * SheetJS. Both write the same sheet layout, so their .xlsx files are
 * interchangeable and the existing DentalCompiler keeps working.
